## Project Overview

This project consists of two distinct components: a frequency hopping application and a separate proof-of-concept
demonstrating potential ASLR mitigation techniques. Both components leverage a Quantum Random Number Generator
(QRNG) from IDQuantique as a source of entropy.

**Component 1: Frequency Hopping Application**

*   **`frequency_hopping_app.py`:** A Tkinter-based GUI application that simulates frequency hopping. It utilizes
a sequence of random numbers generated by the IDQuantique QRNG to determine the hopping frequencies.

**Component 2: ASLR Proof-of-Concept**

*   **`aslr_1.py`:** A separate proof-of-concept demonstrating potential ASLR mitigation techniques. This
component is intended for potential use in a client-side application that communicates with a Frequency Hopping
Spread Spectrum (FHSS) system. It explores how QRNG-derived entropy could influence memory layout.

## Dependencies

*   **Python 3.x**
*   **Tkinter** (usually included with Python)
*   **Requests:** For interacting with the IDQuantique QRNG API. `pip install requests`
*   **IDQuantique QRNG API Key:** You're required to have an API key from IDQuantique to access their QRNG
service.

## Setup

1.  **Obtain an IDQuantique API Key:** Register for an account with IDQuantique and obtain an API key.
2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install requests
    ```
3.  **Configure API Key:** You're required to set the `IDQUANTIQUE_API_KEY` environment variable with your API
key. You can do this in your terminal before running the scripts:

    ```bash
    export IDQUANTIQUE_API_KEY="YOUR_IDQUANTIQUE_API_KEY"
    ```
    Or, you can set it in your IDE's configuration.

4.  **Run the Frequency Hopping Application:**
    ```bash
    python frequency_hopping_app.py
    ```

## Usage

*   **`frequency_hopping_app.py`:** Launches the GUI application. The frequency hopping simulation will use
entropy from the QRNG.
*   **`aslr_1.py`:** This script is a separate proof-of-concept and is intended for potential use in a client-side
application that communicates with a FHSS system. It is not directly executed by the frequency hopping
application.

## Limitations & Considerations

*   **Experimental:** This project is a proof-of-concept and is intended for demonstration purposes only. It is
not a production-ready application.
*   **ASLR Mitigation is Not Guaranteed:** The techniques used to influence memory layout are experimental and may
not be effective in all environments. ASLR is a system-level feature, and its behavior is ultimately controlled by
the operating system.
*   **Independent Components:** The frequency hopping application and the ASLR proof-of-concept are independent
components and do not directly interact with each other during runtime.
